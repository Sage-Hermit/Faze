             <p>Hey Babe, by the time you probably see this you might have heard enough Happy Birthday wishes from me that your head hurt already from me saying it so I won't bother saying it. This is me saying the things I don't tell you regularly.<br>
                &nbsp; You my dear, you are a very rare person with a very big heart. I know you are small but that heart of yours makes up for your physique. The feeling of love i have for you goes deeper than the depth of sea or ocean, everyday I ask myself how have I come to love you this much, how I haven't learnt from my past encounter with love but there is a difference with you. Everything feels better with you, losing myself feels like the right thing with you, doing strange things feels really good with you in the picture. <br>
                &nbsp; You are that amazing, alluring, magnificient, and wonderful woman I want to weave my dreams and desires, to dress me with your kisses. Breaking rules feels normal with you, you are a bad influence but one that I won't stop at anything to continue to be with. I really don't tell you this but you are the BEST person I've met in my life. You are special, a unique being, a unicorn.<br>
                &nbsp; You are an angel amongst humans, If I am not asking too much on this special day of yours, just a glimpse of eternity with you, I promise not to waste your time and you'll remember it full of pleasure even in the afterlife. Let me excuse you the boredom.
            <br>
            <br>
                    &nbsp; Your Lover</p>

             <p> Darling Mifu,

                At night, I lie down and imagine you are here with me.
                I didn't know just how heavy this  would be in my heart.
                I hope you are not in as much utter misery as I am without you.
                They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, and my fondness has no bounds.
                
                I lie awake and feel the gentle warmth of your breath as it would fall on my chest.
                I imagine the heat of my body pressed against yours; the hardness of my muscles nestling against the softness of yours.

                I turn and lay my head against the pillow, I hear your faint breathing in my ear.
                A thousand butterflies kiss at my skin, and I long to feel the softness of your lips.
                While I know we will again be together, my yearning in your absence only cements the true depth of my passion.
                Until I can see you and hold you again, you will remain omnipresent in my dreams.
